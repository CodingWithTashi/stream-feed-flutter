# Activities
## Basics
In Stream Feeds, an item in a feed is called an `activity`. In its simplest form, an `activity` consists of an `actor`, a `verb`, and an `object`. It tells the story of a person performing an action on or with an object.

In its simplest form, adding an activity to a feed means passing an object with the following basic properties:
* `actor`
* `verb`
* `object`

It is also recommended to pass a foreign ID and the Time.

Let's take a look at the following example:

_“Erik is pinning Hawaii to his Places to Visit board.”_

We can identify the components of this activity as follows:
* The `actor` is "Eric" (User:1)
* The `verb` is "pin"
* The `object` is "Hawaii" (Place:42)
* The foreign ID is Eric's "Places to visit board"  (Activity:1)
* The time (for this example) would be `2017-07-01T20:30:45.123`

NOTE: As seen above, the timestamp does not contain any timezone data. However, all Stream timestamps are in UTC time.

## Adding an Activity
Below is an example of adding an activity to a flat feed using our low-level client package, `stream_feed`:

```dart
// Instantiate a feed using feed group 'user' and user id '1' 
var user1 = client.flatFeed('user', '1'); 
 
// Create an activity object 
const activity = Activity(actor: 'User:1', verb: 'pin', object: 'Place:42'); 
 
// Add an activity to the feed 
await user1.addActivity(activity); 
```
