# Feeds
A Feed is like a Stack (FILO) of activities. 
The activities are the building blocks, and the Feed is the stack. 
So if you add a new activity to the stack on top of many other activities 
and retrieve 1 activity, itâ€™ll be the last one you added. 
Feeds do not contain any data other than the type and the id. 
The Feed type allows you to separate concerns and to apply different 
permissions to a group of feeds. 

There are three types of feeds:

1. Flat
2. Aggregated
3. Notification

You can create any kind of feed type in the dashboard for your application.

In this page, we will explore the different feed types in detail. 

## Flat Feeds
Flat is the default feed type - and the **only** feed type that you can follow.
It's not possible to follow either aggregated or notification feeds.

Flat feeds are things like Twitter's timeline - a stream of activity that you 
can subscribe to. You can also get realtime notifications for flat feeds, if 
you enable it for your application.

### Creating a Flat Feed

You can create a flat feed like so:

```dart
final chris = client.flatFeed('user', 'chris');
```

Let's break this apart:
* `client` is an instance of `StreamFeedClient` (defined in a different
piece of code)
* the `flatFeed` method creates an instance of `FlatFeed` and assigns it to the 
variable `chris`

Now, let's examine the `flatFeed` function. This function is defined as a function
of `StreamFeedClient` like so:

```dart
FlatFeed flatFeed(String slug, [String? userId]);
```

A "slug" is a human-readable, unique identifier - basically, an ID. So we are "ID'ing"
our feed as a 'user' feed. (We often call this a "feed group" in our documentation.) You can optionally pass a `userId` to override the `userId`
Stream infers from your token.

You can name your feed anything you want. Just remember to create it in the dashboard
for your application.

### Following a Flat Feed
To follow a flat feed, you need to call the `follow()` function on your feed. This is an
asynchronous function, so you will need to await it. Take the following example:

```dart
final chris = client.flatFeed('user', 'chris');
final jacksTimeline = client.flatFeed('timeline', 'jack');

await chris.follow(jacksTimeline);
```

In this example, we are creating two `FlatFeed`s to represent two different entities, Chris
and Jack, and Chris follows Jack's `FlatFeed`, which in this case is his timeline.

It should be noted that if you would like to follow a single feed in the absence of other feeds,
no action needs to be taken.

You can also subscribe to realtime changes in the feed by calling the `subscribe()` function
on your feed. Here's an example for how to subscribe to realtime changes in a Flutter app:

```dart
late StreamFeedClient _client;
late final Subscription _feedSubscription;

Future<void> _listenToFeed() async {
  _feedSubscription = await _client
    .flatFeed('timeline', widget.currentUser.id)
    .subscribe((message) {
      print(message);
  });
}

@override
void didChangeDependencies() {
  super.didChangeDependencies();
  _client = context.client; // This is an extension! See below.
  _listenToFeed();
}

@override
void dispose() {
  super.dispose();
  // Be sure to cancel your subscription!
  _feedSubscription.cancel();
}

...

extension ProviderX on BuildContext {
  StreamFeedClient get client => ClientProvider.of(this).client;
}

```
