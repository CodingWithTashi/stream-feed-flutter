# Setup

First, you need to add the `stream_feed_flutter` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

You can either run this command:

```zsh
flutter pub add stream_chat_flutter
```

OR

add these lines to the dependencies section of your `pubspec.yaml` after substituting the latest version:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stream_feed_flutter: ^latest_version
```
