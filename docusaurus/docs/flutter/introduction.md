# What function does `stream_feed_flutter` serve?

The UI SDK, `stream_feed_flutter`, contains official Flutter components for Stream Feed, a service for building social feed applications.

While the Stream Feed service provides the backend for messaging and the LLC (low-level client) provides an easy way to use it in your Flutter apps, we wanted to make sure that adding Feed functionality to your app was as quick as possible.

The UI package is built on top of the low-level client and the core package and allows you to build a full fledged application with the built-in components, modify existing components, or easily add widgets of your own to match your app's style better.
